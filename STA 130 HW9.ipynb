    "The contradictio of two statements, \"the model only explains 17.6% of the variability in the data\" and \"many of the coefficients are larger than 10 while having strong or very strong evidence against the null hypothesis of 'no effect\" can be explained as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. When the model \"only explains 17.6% of the variability in the data,\" it means the model doesn't capture most of the factors that affect HP (the outcome we're predicting). There are other things influencing HP that aren't included in this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. When \"many of the coefficients are larger than 10 with strong or very strong evidence against the null hypothesis,\" it means that some of the factors we are using (like \"Sp. Def\" or \"Generation\") have a real effect on HP. This is shown by their small p-values, which indicate that these factors are statistically significant, even if the model as a whole doesn't explain a lot of the variability.\n",

    "R-squared tells us how much of the overall picture (HP) the model explains. Here, it’s only explaining a small part (17.6%).\n",
